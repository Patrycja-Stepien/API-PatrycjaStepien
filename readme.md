The project was focused on creating an interactive pot that will tell the plant owner when the plant needs watering. Handtrack.js gives the possibility to start the interaction by a hand movement. When the hand is detected the pot will inform with a certain type of movement that it needs watering.
handtrack.js allows to use a camera and a video to start the interaction and it allows the user to explore movement detection more.

All the examples and the prototype file is opened by index.html file and all are made by Patrycja Stepien. 

They are based on Victor Dibia API repository:
